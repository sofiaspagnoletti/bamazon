### Overview
This node application has two versions: one of them designed for the customer and the other one designed to meet the store manager's needs. 

#### bamazonCustomers 
Shows the items available to the costumer and asks the user to enter the ID of the product they would like to buy, if the stock quantity of the selected item is enough to meet the desired quantity by the user, the total cost would be shown and the order would be placed. 

#### bamazonManager
Allows the manager to view the products for sale, add new products to the list and check for items with an invetory count lower than five and add more if desired.
